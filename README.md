# Code Generation with GPT-3

The repository contains experiments with the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) for generating HTML documents, Python scripts, and Shell commands from natural language descriptions. The examples provided to GPT-3 can be found in directory [data](data). The experiments are implemented in the notebook [gpt-3-code-gen.ipynb](gpt-3-code-gen.ipynb).
