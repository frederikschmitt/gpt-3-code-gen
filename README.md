# Code Generation with GPT-3

The repository contains experiments with GPT-3 for generation Python code and Bash commands from natural language specifications. The examples of specification-program-pairs provided to GPT-3 can be found in directory data. The experiments are implemented in the notebook gpt-3-code-gen.ipynb. To run the notebook the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY needs to be set.
